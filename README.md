# The omni-executer (omex)
This is a tool I have written purely for myself to quickly:
* open files and webpages
* play media
* start applications

-------
## usage
### open files
`omex -o [alias(defined in config) | filename | URL | executable] <optinal arguments>`
### play media
`omex -p [how] [type]`
e.g. omex -p random music

The tool works with a JSON file where you can define aliases
